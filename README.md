# Systopia Graph Storage Project

To build this project, go to the build directory, and update the paths in paths.sh to reflect your setup.

Then execute the runner.sh script.

We assume that you have autoconf and build tools installed on your machine.

We recommend either of the following Kronecker Generators:

- [Smooth Kronecker Generator](https://github.com/dmargo/smooth_kron_gen)
- [PaRMAT](https://github.com/farkhor/PaRMAT)

The knonecker graph generation script currently uses PaRMAT. You can easily change it to use Smooth Kronecker Gernerator.
